Description: Time Series Daemon from OpenTSDB for storing and accessing time series data
 OpenTSDB is a distributed, scalable Time Series Database (TSDB) written on
 top of HBase.  OpenTSDB was written to address a common need: store, index
 and serve metrics collected from computer systems (network gear, operating
 systems, applications) at a large scale, and make this data easily accessible
 and graphable.
